CONFUSED ABOUT WHICH BUTTON TO CLICK TO SAVE FRIEND
INFO AND THEN LOAD IT TO A TEXT FILE?

"Save Friend To List" button and "Load Friend To List" button
each has a specific number which tells one what list to save
what list and load to. If one happens to click on the
"Save Friend To List(Specific list)" button, one must load friend
to list by clicking on the "Load Friend To List(Exact number
designated to load the saved data to)"

Friends can only be saved one at a time
and to a one of the list user desires.
